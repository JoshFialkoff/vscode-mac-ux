```markdown
**Title:** üçé Finally made VS Code feel native on Mac - one command fixes everything

**Body:**
Spent way too long making VS Code actually feel like a Mac app. Sharing the configuration that fixes all the annoying Windows-isms.

**üéØ What it fixes:**
- Native macOS title bar (bye bye ugly Windows chrome)
- SF Mono font that actually looks good on Retina  
- SSH remote doesn't close your other instances anymore
- Proper Cmd+Left/Right navigation like every other Mac app
- Auto-save that works like TextEdit

3. **Social Proof**: "Spent way too long" implies expertise
4. **Easy Try**: One-line install with backup safety
5. **Multiple Links**: Demo for visual, GitHub for technical
